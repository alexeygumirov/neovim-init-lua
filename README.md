# My Neovim config in Lua

Many NeoVIM users migrate to full Lua config and many need examples of how others done that.

My Neovim config uses [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as a plugin manager.
Maybe later I will migrate to [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim). But as of today, I am happy with the **VIM Plug**.
